##### Models that I am interested in:
- [[RTX 4070 Super]]
- [[RTX 4070 Ti Super]]
- [[RTX 4080]]
- [[RTX 4080 Super]]

##### General info:
It is advised to underclock / undervolt the GPU slightly so it mayu work even 10 Celcius degrees lower without almost losing any performance. This is a subject that I should check and learn more and see: 
- how it is possible on Linux as well?
- or is it done on BIOS level?
