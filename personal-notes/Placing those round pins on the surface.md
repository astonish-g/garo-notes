##### Brain storming:
- Array along curves?

- Array along a path?

##### Possible method one:
- Create the parent surface first.
- Make edge loops in it, as much as you need to serve as a path for your arrays.
- Select the curves and separate them with **Ctrl+P**.
- Turn them into curves.
- Use those curves as array path.
