##### Brain storming:
- Array along curves?
	- **YT Tutorial:** [Array along a curve without deformation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiQARXtMhTI)
	- **YT Tutorial:** [Array along curve without distortion and align to a surface](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twDewbork9o) ==This one looks interesting, may be the answer to my question==
- Array along a path?
	- **YT Tutorial:** [Array along a path](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjw3I-h5r6EAxUNefEDHaYDC4gQtwJ6BAgmEAI&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DHC-hINTb_14&usg=AOvVaw1zbxWYRYTVp0M0cpHdtOcM&opi=89978449)

##### Possible method one:
- Create the parent surface first.
- Make edge loops in it, as much as you need to serve as a path for your arrays.
- Select the curves and separate them with **Ctrl+P**.
- Turn them into curves.
- Use those curves as array path.
